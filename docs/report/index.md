## Editing and Layout

In Starwhale's Report, we use "blocks" to refer to structured elements. Each type of content in the report is a "block", including text, headings, code, and panels, etc.

You can insert "blocks" while editing a report to create a satisfactory report.

Type **/** into an empty line in a report or an appropriate location in the main text, and trigger the **Quick Insert** by pressing **Space /**. Then select the desired "block" from the toolbar menu.
